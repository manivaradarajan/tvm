1.4.1
Gentle lovely winged crane, my angel!
Surely you and your handsome winged amour 
Feel my pain. Were you to carry my missive 
To him who rides on the bird of blazing wings
He may cage you up, but would it be so bad?

1.4.2
Would it hurt you to be my emissary
    and say a few words
to my lord 
     of red lotus eyes?

Cuckoos, does this not suit you?

My endless past kept me from even trying 
     to serve his glorious feet.

Is being apart my fate now?

1.4.3
Fortunate swans!
     Your gentle gait bespeaks
          of union with your mates

Go tell that cheat 
     who shrewdly
         begged for the universe
             as a dwarf student

      “There’s a delirious woman
             who’s nearing her end
   
               She’s crying out

‘What a fool I am! 
Will I never be free of 
  my past crimes?’ ”

1.4.4
My beloved dark as a rain cloud
     won’t see my plight
          and say in solace
               “This isn’t right!”

Oh, what more can I even say? 

Good dark lovebirds, just tell him this much:
    “She won’t last much longer!”

Will you do this for me? Won’t you?

1.4.5
With love he protects and nurtures the seven worlds
Yet he witholds his love just from
                                            wretched me 

Generous little heron
    seeking prey
        in the garden’s teeming streams!

Should you see Narayana

Grace me 
        eyes brimming with tears
 with just one word back.

1.4.6
        “You’re not showing your favor.
     Be kind before her life withers away!
Dispatch your eagle — that ocean of grace —
             down her street just once!”

Tell him this, kind plump striped bees
    if you see
        that gracious discus bearing lord.
    
Oh, what wrongs must we have done?

1.4.7
The cool breeze stabs my bones
    like threads being strung through.

Graciously seeing my faults alone
    Lakshmi’s Passion graces me not;

 “What could she have done to offend thy grace?”

Just ask him this, lovable parrot
    who chisels my very bones.
Were you not the one I nurtured?

1.4.8
Sweet little myna!
Wasn’t it you
    I asked to tell the Great Lover
        of my suffering?

And you just sat there
    without saying a word.

Now I’ve lost my radiance
   and my looks.

Go find another
    to put sweet morsels
        in your mouth.

1.4.9
To place rare flowers every day
    at Narayana’s unfading lotus feet

That’s what I was made for.

I’m removed from him
   drowning
       doomed.
What am I to do?

Cool breeze, you get around!

Explain this to him –
then come
    and prick my body.

1.4.10
Being the cycle of birth and death
    life itself and everything else

My lord rests in the vast ocean
    his discus ready at hand.

Fathomless true mind!

If you see him
    tell him all this
and don’t leave ill-fated me
    till we’re reunited.

1.4.11
These ten of a thousand endless verses
    were sung well by
Satakopan of magnificent Kurukur
        flush with fertile fields

On Kannan
    the great lord
        of all who live
            in the vast seven worlds.

Exuberant recitation of these
    yields the great wealth of heaven.
